# Facial Recognition for Emotion Detection
A Machine Learning Approach
Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically facial recognition, to detect human emotions from images. The goal is to assess the efficiency of machine learning models in interpreting complex emotional states, with potential applications in healthcare, customer feedback, sales, and autonomous systems.

Key Features
Utilizes the FER2013 dataset, containing 35,887 grayscale facial images labeled with seven emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Neutral.

Implements a RandomForestClassifier for its robustness in handling high-dimensional data and classifying complex emotional expressions.

Includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Evaluates model accuracy and provides a detailed classification report for each emotion.

Results
Accuracy: 45.28%

Best-Performing Emotions: Disgust (precision: 1.00, F1-score: 0.56) and Surprise (precision: 0.69, F1-score: 0.63).

Challenges: Lower performance for Anger and Neutral emotions, suggesting potential confusion with other emotions or dataset imbalances.

Future Directions
Address dataset imbalances to improve recognition of underrepresented emotions.

Explore advanced neural network models like CNNs or ResNet for enhanced accuracy.

Expand the dataset to include more diverse demographics and subtle expressions.
